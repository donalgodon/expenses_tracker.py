# expenses_tracker.py
 We have a list of expenses, where each entry includes a category, an ammount and a price. Also there will be an input to set the budget.  The code will calculate the total, average and maximun expenses and categorize spendings to show totals for each category as well as advert if you have exceeded the budget.
